Python reference project

- Sample project that evolved while self-learning Python3.
- Using an object-oriented style to help me get a feel for how Python can do this. 
- Includes basic GUI using TKinter - written using a declaritive style (even though tkinter doesn't really support this (it flickers a lot as each frame is re-drawn(!))).

To run:

$ python3 world_gui.py  
and clickety-click around...

- 2019-11-22 Added save-to/load-from file functionality; some UI improvements
- 2019-11-28 more dead-checks, slight re-layout, added speech
- 2019-11-29 further death-consistency action-checks
